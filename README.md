# Spotify Login UI 
This project simulates the spotify login UI

## Motivation
My general motivation in this project was to challenge myself with some new concepts. Specifically pertaining to designing and styling. I love coding, but how good is a web page without a pleasant UI/UX. Therefore, this was my step in the direction of getting better at styling. I learned a lot during it and it made me fall more in love with the power of front-end design. Overall, this was very fun to do, and I really enjoyed it.
